The model card describes the publisher's model, not this JAX port's quality.
No published WER/CER or performance table is adopted as an application result.
The fixed commit is an intentionally reviewed source, not a floating-latest claim.
Weight and vocabulary bytes are fetched and checked by the user's runtime, not
pretended to have been fully downloaded during packaging.

Breeze-ASR-25 targets Taiwanese Mandarin and Mandarin–English code-switching.
Breeze-ASR-26 targets Taigi input with Mandarin Chinese-character output, not
native Taigi orthography. Both are separate use cases, not a ranked replacement.
