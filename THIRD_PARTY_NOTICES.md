# Third-party notices

The inference engine is an original compact JAX implementation of the standard
Whisper architecture. Its equations, audio decoding conventions, timestamp
constraints were checked against the
OpenAI Whisper implementation. It is not endorsed by Google, OpenAI, or Hugging Face.
The new notebook glue and inference implementation may be used under the MIT
terms below. Preserve the OpenAI notice for the referenced/adapted decoding logic.

Model weights, tokenizer assets, JAX, SciPy, NumPy, SafeTensors, Hugging Face Hub,
FFmpeg, and their dependencies retain their own licenses. Weights and
third-party binary packages are downloaded at runtime, not redistributed here.
The notebook uses one pinned MediaTek-Research/Breeze-ASR-26 checkpoint.
No model weights or recorded user audio are bundled. The notebook UI was inspired by a
user-supplied compact Colab example; its faster-whisper backend is not used.

Modelcard descriptions are paraphrased with attribution. Test vocabularies and
synthetic tensor fixtures are application tests, not distributed model weights.

The small `tests/fixtures/publisher-token-contract.json` contains selected special
IDs transcribed from MediaTek-Research's published Breeze-ASR-26 tokenizer and
generation files, with source URLs. They remain under their publisher's Apache-2.0
model-asset terms. Ordinary fixture vocabulary and test tensors are synthetic.
